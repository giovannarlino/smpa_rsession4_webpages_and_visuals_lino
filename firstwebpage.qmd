## My first web page

Hi there! This is my first attempt at making a web page.

1.  **Bananas**

<!-- -->

2.  **Apples**
3.  
4.  **Ice Cream**

I am going to add a link to this [story](https://github.com/giovannarlino/smpa_rsession4_webpages_and_visuals_lino) (by clicking on the link icon on top of the page)

| XXX | XXX | XXX |
|-----|-----|-----|

#For a picture, you have to upload it first in the right column to then add the picture in the panel

## Running Code

## Another Head 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
